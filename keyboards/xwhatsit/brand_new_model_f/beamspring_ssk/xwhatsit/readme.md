A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports the brand new beamspring reproductions from https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/, using the (non-default) original Xwhatsit model F rev. 1 or rev. 2 controller PCB.
  WARNING: All the keyboards that ship from modelfkeyboards.com come with a "wcass" controller PCB,
  and the controller supported by this QMK subfolder is not compatible with that.
  This subfolder is only useful if you decide to modify your keyboard, and replace the controller PCB
  with a non-default one. Otherwise please choose the "wcass" subfolder.
* Hardware Availability: https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make xwhatsit/brand_new_model_f/beamspring_ssk/xwhatsit:default
